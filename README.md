# Introduction to R for Epidemiologists

Welcome! This course assumes knowledge of epidemiology but does not assume knowledge of R. It is intended to introduce epidemiologists to R for their research. 

- For each topic, there is an online tutorial that can be completed online without installing R on your desktop. Complete these before doing the homework assignments. 
-  Homework must be submitted through [okpy.org](https://okpy.org/). Only students registered in UC Berkeley intermediate epidemiology courses will be able to submit homework for grading. 
- The reading suggestions are from Hadley Wickham's free ebook [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). These are optional readings that can serve as a supplement to the tutorials for students who find them helpful.
