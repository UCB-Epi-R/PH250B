# Introduction to R for Epidemiologists

Welcome! This course assumes knowledge of epidemiology but does not assume knowledge of R. It is intended to introduce epidemiologists to R for their research. For each topic, there is an online tutorial, and in most cases there is also a homework assignment. The reading suggestions are from Hadley Wickham's free ebook [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). These are optional readings that can serve as a supplement to the tutorials for students who find them helpful.
